## TO CREATE A NEW INSTANCE
##
## 1. Create the instance of UBUNTU Server 16.04LTS, t2.micro using default settings
##    so that it has a public IP address, and using safecastdev key
## 2. Assign the correct security group, i.e.
##    In Actions / Networking / Change Security Groups, select the TTSERVE security group and Assign Security Groups
## 3. Add the instance to both the 80 and 8080 load balancer Target Groups
## 4. Make sure that locally you have the safecastdev.pem key on your keychain ie
##    ssh-add -K /keybase/private/rozzie,matschaffer/safecastdev.pem
## 5. SSH into the instance using ubuntu@<instance-domain-name>
##

##
## FIRST TIME INSTANCE SETUP PROCEDURE
##

## Update the updater
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt update
## Install GIT so we can pull new versions
sudo apt install git --assume-yes
## Install GOLANG so we can rebuild our code
sudo apt install golang-go --assume-yes
go version
## If not AT LEAST go 1.12 (for module support)
## instructions: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get remote golang-go
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install golang-go
go version

## Install emacs (or the editor of your choice)
sudo apt-get install emacs

## Fetch our app package
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/safecast/safestream

## Use "crontab -e" and add this line
@reboot screen -dmS safestream $HOME/safestream/run.sh

## Make sure that this linux instance doesn't run out of disk space because of accumulation of linux headers
## in /usr/src by setting this to "true":
sudo emacs /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies "true";

## By the way, if you ever need to clean up disk space because you forgot to do this:
## remove a few folders in /usr/src manually via
## sudo rm -rf linux-headers-4.4.0-101
## now that there is space, download the LATEST headers
## sudo apt-get -f install
## now that the latest headers are installed, purge the older ones
## sudo apt autoremove --purge
## verify everything works after a restart
## sudo shutdown -r 0

## REBOOT THE AWS INSTANCE
sudo shutdown -r 0
## You can then come back via SSH and use 'screen' to look around
